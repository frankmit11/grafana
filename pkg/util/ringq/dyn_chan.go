// DynChanMax provides a simple queueing system based on a send-only, a
// receive-only, and an internal ring buffer queue, which has dynamic capcity.
// It also provides a ChanStatsReader to allow querying basic stats. The
// internal ring buffer is initially empty, and its capacity grows as more items
// need to be stored if the receiving side is lagging behind. When the receiving
// side catches up, the buffer will shrink to reclaim unused memory. The
// argument minBufLen must be positive, and allows customizing the minimum
// allocation for the internal buffer. This is useful to reduce the overhead of
// resizing the buffer within an acceptable, permanent allocation of minBufLen
// items ready to be used. If maxBufLen is positive, then it must be greater
// than minBufLen, and will be used to prevent buffering more than that number
// of items. If more items are received and the buffer already has maxBufLen,
// then the oldest item (the one that receiving would first get) will be
// overwritten with the new value.
